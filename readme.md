# placement

Purpose of this zig library is to make calculations with 3D positions and rotations easier.

Features:

    [x] quaternions for orientation
    [x] float type can be easily swapped

Design Choices:

    * positions use the same 'Vec' struct as the orientations and thus have 1 coordinate that is always 0
